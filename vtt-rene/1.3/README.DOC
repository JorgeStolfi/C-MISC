This is freeware with no commercial value. It may be distributed
freely, on the condition that it comes with this file (README.DOC)
unmodifided.
The author does not accept any responsibility for damage to files
or file systems caused by the use of this software (but be assured
that it should not do any damage to either when used properly and
without modification).

Comments of any (polite) kind will find a friendly ear from me.

Now that you can read this file you have already figured out
most of what to do. You have successfully uudecoded, unzipped
and untarred it.

You should see the following files:

README.DOC : This file
vtt.c      : Source code
vtt.doc    : Documentation
vtt.exe    : MS-DOS executable
vtt        : Solaris 2.4 executable

The MS-DOS executable was kindly compiled and linked by
Martin McCarthy.
The Solaris 2.4 executable uses dynamic libraries.
If this turns out to be a problem, try to relink it statically
yourself, or if all fails get in touch with me.
I would appreciate if the first Mac user to build an executable 
successfully send a copy to me so that it can be added to the
package.
