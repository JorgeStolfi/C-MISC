THINGS TO DO

Wavefront modeling

  Use a C1 model with bicubic patches.  In particular, use the
  endpoint velocities and cubic interpolation when inserting 
  new vertices in an edge.
  
  Store wave energy in triangles and manage it when breaking or contracting
  edges.
  
Density control

  Implement at least some cases of edge contraction, or use a different strategy.
  
  Detect crossover, i.e. degenerate {prox--curr} prisms.

Plotting

  Move mesh*.{h,c} to JSLIBS/libgeo or to a separate JSLIBS/libmesh package.
  
  Move plotwfc.c to ~/programs/c/geoplot, make it into a generic mesh plotter.
  Add depth-sorting of trianglets, or (better) full visibility processing.
  
  Rename {ouput_wave} to {plot_wave}.
  
  Add {plot_model}, that outputs a mesh instead of the model itself.
