  /* Reads from the file {rd} a description of
    how to group, orient, and pack plates, in the format 
    described in {csc_group_file_INFO}.
    
    More specifically, the procedure reads from the file zero or more
    input items ({sheet_cut_node_t} records) which may be plates or blocks.
    The procedure returns a vector of the (top-level) items in the file
    
    When the procedure reads a plate tag, it locates the 
    corresponding {sheet_cut_node_t} in the vector {plv},
    and uses that record instead.  That entry is then
    set to {NULL} (so that each plate can be used only once).
    
    When the procedure reads a '[', it calls itself recursively to parse
    the grouping data up to the matching ']'. That call returns a list
    of {sheet_cut_node_t} records (plates or blocks). These nodes are
    made into children of a block item, stacked horizontally, with
    {cut_wd} of space between them.
    
    The {level} is the recursion depth, used only for debugging purposes. */
