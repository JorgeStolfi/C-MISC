This directory contains the source for "ioplot", a simple program to generate
multi-level "ham slice" plots in Encapsulated Postscrip format.
 
DOCUMENTATION

  To get the manpage, execute "ioplot -info" (or "ioplot -help" for a short reminder).

  Other examples of use can be found in tests/Makefile.

  Samples of output plots can be found in tests/out-check

BUILDING

  The code and Makefile seem to work on Fedora GNU/Linux as installed on my machine.
  They will probably need adjustments for other environments.  
  
  Executing "make" at the root directory will compile all modules and link the 
  executable "ioplot".
  
  You may have to delete the file "Deps.make".
  
  Executing "make" in the "tests" sub-directory should run three examples and 
  display the output Postscript files (in the "tests/out" sub-directory).
  If all goes well, they should be identical to the files in "tests/out-check".
