This directory contains scripts to create test instances from
various problem classes and then run several implementations on 
those instances.  All scripts work by
writing an instance to a temporary file and then running each
specified implementation on that instance.  Output is placed
in appropiately named files in the results directory.  

There are several parameter values affecting behaviour which can
either be set as environment variables or in the scripts. These
include:

bindir		binary locatation
resultsdir	results directory
prognames	list of implementations to execute
numvertices	list of graph sizes (not used by Karz)
typelist	list of graph types for unibm or unimf 
cutnumseeds	number of seeds used for each graph size
seedlist	list of seeds to use


The files in this directory include:

 Blow 		script used to create family of unimf
 Dobl		"
 Puff		"
 Saus		"
 Squa		"
 Wave		"
 Makefile	used to pow

 apsqrt		calculates approx. square root (used by unimf scripts)
 ex-prog	set arguments required for specific implementatiosn
 pow.c		calculate exponentiation (used by run-rmfu)
 run-HiLo	runs HiLo generator
 run-Karz	runs Karz generator
 run-all	run all problem generators
 run-bim	run all bipartite matching generators
 run-rbg2	run rgb2 generator (takes fewg or manyg as parameter)
 run-rmfu	run rmfu generator (takes wide, cube or long ar parameter)
 run-uf		run all unit-flow generators
 run-unibm	run unibm generator (takes list of classes as parameter)
 run-unimf	run unibm generator (takes list of classes as parameter)
