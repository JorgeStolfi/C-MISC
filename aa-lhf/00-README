This directory contains an old version of Luiz Henrique Figueiredo's
package for Affine Arithmetic. It uses the vector representation
without rounding control.

The original source files by LHF are dated from around 1994-11-30.
They were updated to account for environmet changes by J. Stolfi on
several occasions between 1994 and 2004.
