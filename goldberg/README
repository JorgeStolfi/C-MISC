To compile the C and C++ code (both the implementations of
the algorithms and the generators):

1) edit the file make.config in this directory -- change BASE to point
to this directory and change CC and CXX to your C and C++ compiler
respectively

2) from this directory type 
	make install

The binaries will then all be found in the bin subdirectory.  
The implementations all expect to receive input from standard input
and write output to standard output.  There are scripts in the
scripts directory which run the implementations on the generators
provided in this distribution.

The file make.config is included by all makefiles in this distribution, 
it is used to set optimization flags and other options which are common to
multiple applications.  

To compile the unibm and unimf generators you will require a modula-3
compiler.  Change directory to Generators/unibm/src (or Generators/unimf/src)
and type m3build.
